When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Chunck options: 

* echo: prevent code, but not results, to appear  
* include: False prevent code and results to appear  
* eval: if False, the code will not be run  
* message: prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file   
* warning: prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished  
* collapse: if TRUE, knitr will collapse all the source and output blocks created by the chunk into a single block  
* results: If 'hide', knitr will not display the codeâ€™s results in the final document. If  'hold', knitr will delay displaying all output pieces until the end of the chunk. If 'asis', knitr will pass through results without reformatting them (useful if results return raw HTML, etc.)
